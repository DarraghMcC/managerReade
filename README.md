## Motivation for this document
Interacting with people can be complex. As a subset of people, this is also true of managers. To try to make this complexity a little easier to handle the following is my humble attempt at capturing my management style, philosophy, and expectations. 

The intended audience is anyone I work with but I would particularly encourage anyone who reports to me to take a read.

This document may evolve as I encounter areas that require clarity but I do ask that any reader holds me accountable for statements made here, to help me better improve as a manager.

## My role
My primary focus is helping the Engineering team achieve.

To me this means empowering teams to deliver customer value, encouraging them to grow and ensuring that they feel happy and motivated in their roles. 

## What do I value most?
I value openness. I'm personally a very open person, and value openness in those around me. I never expect someone to share beyond what they are comfortable with on a personal level, but I do expect openness when it comes to professional needs and struggles. I will always try to create a safe space for open discussion of fears, worries and struggles related to your role.

I value autonomy. I am not a micromanager. I will do my best to be a guiding light, but I expect and trust you to drive your own work and your own personal growth. 

I value Feedback. Feedback is an incredible tool for growth at our disposal, and I encourage it in all areas. I believe good feedback is respectful but candid and I will try foster a culture of this. I will give feedback whenever I have it and I would appreciate the same back. 

## Communicating with me
I do check emails, but DMing me on Slack is likely the best way to get my attention. I endeavour to treat being there for my team as a priority. If you need an immediate response, say so, I will drop most tasks/meetings to get back to your immediately. 

## 1:1s
I will have regular 1:1s with everyone who reports to me. I do not expect these to be status reports, but I will listen if that's what you would like to share. This is your time, I may have information or feedback to share but for the most part, I expect you to set the agenda. If you have no agenda in mind, I am happy to just catch up and chat.

## Other bits and bobs
I like to play devil's advocate, so if I push back on an idea you have, it does not mean I necessarily disagree. 

I am Irish, I moved to New Zealand in late 2018.
